Wind Speed Prediction with ARIMA&NNAR:

* In this study, ARIMA and NNAR approaches were applied using R and the results were compared.
* The dataset was divided into training and testing sets.
*	The pre-processing and exploratory data analysis steps were performed to dealing with missing values and outliers.
*	AUTOARIMA function was used to set ARIMA parameters.
*	Models perform well, and was hard to decide which one is the most accurate from the visualizationâ€™s plots.
*	According to the evaluation metrics (MASE & MAPE & MAD), ARIMA was the best in forecasting wind speed.
